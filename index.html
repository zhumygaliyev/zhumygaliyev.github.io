						<p><span>M</span>y name is Ernar, I am 18 years old. I am a 2nd year student. I study at Satpayev University. I was born in the city of Satpayev, which is located in the Karaganda region. I studied well at school, even very well. I have 5 people in my family. Dad, Mom, sister, me and younger brother. Now I really miss them. I am 1362 km away from home. My parents brought me up well, so I try not to upset them. As a child, I even went abroad in Kazakhstan. We were in Bashkortostan. Our distant relatives are there. It was very interesting by the way. Scroll to the left and you will read what I am fond of.</p>

						<h2 class="universal-h2 universal-h2-bckg">About me</h2>
						<p><span>F</span>irst of all, I really love football. I play in the yard with the guys, we have already formed a real team. I don't like mini-football because there is a lot to wait for the game itself. I don't like sitting on the bench. I need to play - run! I also love computer games - strategy especially. Where you need to build something, gather armies – capture neighbors to expand the territory. I look at game reviews, read tips on how to learn game secrets.</p>

					<p>“I am a Kazakh myself. Do I love or hate Kazakhs? If I had loved, I would have loved. I had to find something to love. I had to do it to make sure that I didn't lose hope, or that I didn't have it, or that I didn't have it, or that I didn't have it. If I hated, I didn't talk, I didn't sit down, I didn't sit down, I didn't sit down, I didn't sit down, I didn't go to the group and say, "what happened?"I had to get out of the middle of it if I couldn't. I have no hope that I will repair them, repair them, learn. Not one of them. How is this? "I'm sorry," she said.
					Although I myself am alive, I am obviously not alive. It is not for nothing that I am the only one who has ever heard of such a thing, but because I am the only one who has ever heard of such a thing. "I don't know. I'm not sure if I'm healthy, but my stomach is normal to die. If I'm angry, I can't be angry. I'm not sure if I'm happy or not, I'm not happy, I'm not happy, I'm not happy. "I don't know," I said. When I had finished, I went to the other side of the house, and the fire was gone. "I don't know," I said. In fact, I think: this is also good, when I die "attegene-AI, I am also interested!"don't be sad, don't be sad, don't be sad, don't be sad, don't be sad, don't be sad.”</p>

					<p>“When a person is born from his parents, he does not hear: if he hears, sees, catches, tastes, knows the good and the bad in the world, then the more he knows, the more he sees, the more he learns. "I don't know," he said. Not every sound is suitable for the individual. If you take into account the good things you have heard and learned, if you are afraid of the bad, then you can do it, and then you can say that you are a person. When you hear such a word, you shake, shake, or hang up, or you hear it. It is not for nothing that one Hakim said that it is better to take care of a pig that knows itself, until such a word is spoken to a country that does not know itself.”</p>
